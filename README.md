We want to create a game where the user has to avoid obstacles and climb an infinitely 
tall building. The goal is to survive as long as possible because the game times how long the 
character has been alive. By the end, this game should get more difficult as the time passes and
record the players best time.

# Phase 1
- [x] Display game setting (building, floors, obstacles)
- [x] Create game character
- [x] Make character jump and move(left to right and right to left), user controls with keyboard
- Phase 1 Demo Link: https://youtu.be/ESKKJJDGknc

# Phase 2
- [x] Collision with obstacles(new floor and dying)
- [x] Infinitely scrolling screen
- [x] Randomly generating obstacles

# Phase 3
- [ ] Timer that stops when character dies and displays best time
- [ ] Game over screen
- [ ] Game gets increasingly more difficult
