# Jumper

Our game has the user jump platforms and avoid falling obstacles.

# About
We created a game where the user has to avoid obstacles and climb an infinitely 
scrolling screen. If one of the red triangles hits the player, the game ends. If the player is
on a platform when it hits the ground, the game ends. The goal is to survive as long as possible
because the game times how long the player has been alive. The game gets more difficult the longer
the player survives because the obstacles will start falling faster and there will be more obstacles.
When the player dies, a game over screen will be displayed and the player's time.
